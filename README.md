# CS61A Fall 2022

This is my coursework for self-studying UC Berkeley CS61A, Fall 2022.
For an overview of the course, please see the [course syllabus](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/fa22/articles/about/#overview).
I completed all the labs, homework, and projects, but not the discussions.
I took some notes in the [note folder](note) for the weekly lectures.
